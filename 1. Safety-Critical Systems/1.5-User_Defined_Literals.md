# User-Defined Literals
**User-defined literals** are a unique feature in all mainstream programming languages, since they enable us to combine values with units.

## Syntax
Literals are explicit values in a program, including a boolean like true, the number 3 or 4.15; the char a, or the C string "hello". The lambda function [](int a, int b){ return a+b; } is also a function literal.

With C++11, it is possible to generate user-defined literals by adding a suffix to a built-in literal for the int, float, char, and C strings.

User-defined literals must obey the following syntax:

```
<built_in-Literal>  _  <Suffix>
```

Usually, we use the suffix for a unit:

## Examples
```
101000101_b
63_s
10345.5_dm
123.45_km
100_m
131094_cm
33_cent
"Hello"_i18n
```

What is the key benefit of user-defined literals? The C++ compiler maps the user-defined literals to the corresponding literal operator, and this literal operator must be implemented by the programmer.

## The Magic
Let’s take a look at the user-defined literal 0101001000_b which represents a binary value. The compiler maps the user-defined literal 0101001000_b to the literal operator operator"" _b (long long int bin).

A few special rules are important to follow:
- There must be a space between the quotation marks and the suffix.
- The binary value (0101001000) is in the variable bin.
- If the compiler doesn’t find the corresponding literal operator, the compilation will fail.

With C++14, we get an alternative syntax for user-defined types. They differ from the C++11 syntax because user-defined types in require no space. Therefore, it is possible to use reserved keywords like _C as a suffix and use a user-defined literal of the form. This can be seen with 11_C. The compiler will map 11_C to the literal operator"" _C (unsigned long long int). The simple rule states that we can use suffixes starting with an upper-case letter.

User-defined literals are a very helpful feature in modern C++ if we want to write safety-critical software. Why? Due to the automatic mapping of the user-defined literal to the literal operator, we can implement type-safe arithmetic.

The concept will be further explained with an example in the following lesson.

## -Example
In this lesson, we will look at an example of user-defined literals.

```
//userDefinedLiteral.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ostream>

namespace Distance{
  class MyDistance{
    public:
      MyDistance(double i):m(i){}

      friend MyDistance operator +(const MyDistance& a, const MyDistance& b){
        return MyDistance(a.m + b.m);
      }
      friend MyDistance operator -(const MyDistance& a, const MyDistance& b){
        return MyDistance(a.m - b.m);
      }

      friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream &out, const MyDistance& myDist){
        out << myDist.m << " m";
         return out;
      }
    private:
      double m;

  };

  namespace Unit{
    MyDistance operator "" _km(long double d){
      return MyDistance(1000*d);
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _m(long double m){
      return MyDistance(m);
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _dm(long double d){
      return MyDistance(d/10);
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _cm(long double c){
      return MyDistance(c/100);
    }
  }
}

using namespace Distance::Unit;

int main(){

  std:: cout << std::endl;

  std::cout << "1.0_km: " << 1.0_km << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_m: " << 1.0_m << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_dm: " << 1.0_dm << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_cm: " << 1.0_cm << std::endl;


  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_km + 2.0_dm +  3.0_dm - 4.0_cm: " << 1.0_km + 2.0_dm +  3.0_dm - 4.0_cm << std::endl;
  std::cout << std::endl;

}
```

## Explamation
- The literal operators are implemented in the namespace Distance::unit. We should use namespaces for user-defined literals due to two reasons. First, the suffixes are typically quite short. Second, the suffixes typically stand for units that are already established abbreviations. In the program, we used the suffixes km, m, dm, and cm.
- For the class MyDistance, we overloaded the basic arithmetic operators (lines 10 - 15) and the output operator (lines 17 - 19). The operators are global functions, and can use - thanks to their friendship - the internals of the class. We store the output distance in the private variable m.
- We display, in lines 48 - 51, the various distances. In lines 27 to 37, we calculate the meter in various resolutions. The literal operators take as argument a long double and return a MyDistance object. MyDistance is automatically normalized to meters.
- The last test looks quite promising: 1.0_km + 2.0_dm + 3.0_dm - 4.0_cm is 1000.54 m (line 55). The compiler takes care of the calculations with all units.

Get a better understanding of this topic with a few exercises in the next lesson.

## -Exercise
In this exercise, you will extend the MyDistance class from the example in the previous lesson.

## Task 1
Extend MyDistance from the previous example to support the following units:

1. Feet (ft)
- 1 ft = 0.3048m
2. Mile (mi)
- 1mi = 1609.344m

> Tip: Define a good suffix for these units as well.

## Task 2
Your weekly drive with your car consists of many components: work, workPerDay,workout, abbrevationToWork and shopping.

```
workPerDay = 2 * work;
```

Extend MyDistance so you can calculate the total distance of your weekly drive. An example follows:

```Distance::myDistance myDisPerWeek;
myDistPerWeek= 4 * workPerDay - 3 * abbrevationToWork + workout + shopping;
```

```
//userDefinedLiteral.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <ostream>

namespace Distance{
  class MyDistance{
    public:
      MyDistance(double i):m(i){}

      friend MyDistance operator +(const MyDistance& a, const MyDistance& b){
        return MyDistance(a.m + b.m);
      }
      friend MyDistance operator -(const MyDistance& a, const MyDistance& b){
        return MyDistance(a.m - b.m);
      }

      friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream &out, const MyDistance& myDist){
        out << myDist.m << " m";
         return out;
      }
    private:
      double m;

  };

  namespace Unit{
    MyDistance operator "" _km(long double d){
      return MyDistance(1000*d);
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _m(long double m){
      return MyDistance(m);
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _dm(long double d){
      return MyDistance(d/10);
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _cm(long double c){
      return MyDistance(c/100);
    }
  }
}

using namespace Distance::Unit;

int main(){

  std:: cout << std::endl;

  std::cout << "1.0_km: " << 1.0_km << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_m: " << 1.0_m << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_dm: " << 1.0_dm << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_cm: " << 1.0_cm << std::endl;


  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_km + 2.0_dm +  3.0_dm - 4.0_cm: " << 1.0_km + 2.0_dm +  3.0_dm - 4.0_cm << std::endl;
  std::cout << std::endl;

}
```

  std::cout << "4 * workPerDay - 3 * abbrevationToWork + workout + shopping: " << myDistancePerWeek;

  std::cout << "\n\n";

}
```

## Explanation
- The mile unit is implemented in lines 31-32.
- The feet unit is implemented in lines 40-41.
- The components work, workPerDay, workout, abbrevationToWork, and shopping are defined in lines 75-79.
- In line 81, we have computed myDistancePerWeek using the components we have defined above.

In the next lesson, we will learn about the raw and cooked forms of user-defined literals.
