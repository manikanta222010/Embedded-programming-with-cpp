# The Facts of auto
Automatic type deduction with auto is extremely convenient. Firstly, we save unnecessary typing, in particular with challenging template expressions. Secondly, the compiler does not make human errors.

The compiler automatically deduces the type from the initializer:
```
auto myDoub = 3.14;
```
## Key Features
- The techniques for automatic function template argument deductions are used.
- It is very helpful in complicated template expressions.
- It empowers us to work with unknown types.
- It must be used with care in combination with initializer lists.

The following code compares the definition of explicit and deduced types:
```
#include <vector>

int myAdd(int a,int b){ return a+b; }

int main(){

  // define an int-value
  int i= 5;                                  // explicit
  auto i1= 5;                                // auto
 
  // define a reference to an int
  int& b= i;                                 // explicit
  auto& b1= i;                               // auto
 
  // define a pointer to a function
  int (*add)(int,int)= myAdd;               // explicit
  auto add1= myAdd;                         // auto
  
  // iterate through a vector
  std::vector<int> vec;
  for (std::vector<int>::iterator it= vec.begin(); it != vec.end(); ++it){} 
  for (auto it1= vec.begin(); it1 != vec.end(); ++it1) {}

}
```
>  C++ Insights helps us to visualize of the types that the compiler deduces. Andreas Fertig, author of this tool, wrote a few [blog] enteries (https://www.modernescpp.com/index.php/c-insights-type-deduction) about auto as well.

# auto-matically Initialized
auto determines its type from an initializer, meaning that without an initializer, there is no type and nor variable. Simply put, the compiler takes care of each type that is initialized. This is a nice side effect of auto that is rarely mentioned.

It makes no difference if we forgot to initialize a variable or did not make it because we failed to understand the language The result is the same: undefined behavior. With auto, we can overcome these errors.

Moving on from that overview, let’s implement auto in a few examples. Before moving on, do you know all the rules for the initialization of a variable? If yes, congratulations! Let’s move forward. If not, read the article default initialization and all referenced articles in this article before continuing with the examples.

The aforementioned article states that “objects with automatic storage duration (and their sub-objects) are initialized to indeterminate values”. This formulation causes more harm than good. Local variables that are not user-defined will not be initialized by default.

In the following samples, we modified the second program of default initialization to make the undefined behavior clearer.

## Sample Code 1
```
// init.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
struct T1 {};
 
struct T2{
    int mem;     // Not ok: indeterminate value
 public:
    T2() {} 
};
 
int n;          //  ok: initialized to 0
 
int main(){
  
  std::cout << std::endl;
  
  int n;               // Not ok: indeterminate value
  std::string s;       // ok: Invocation of the default constructor; initialized to "" 
  T1 t1;               // ok: Invocation of the default constructor 
  T2 t2;               // ok: Invocation of the default constructor
    
  std::cout << "::n " << ::n << std::endl;
  std::cout << "n: " << n << std::endl;
  std::cout << "s: " << s << std::endl;
  std::cout << "T2().mem: " << T2().mem << std::endl;
  
  std::cout << std::endl;
                      
}
```

## Explanation 1
First, let us discuss the scope resolutions operator :: is used in line 25. :: addresses the global scope. In our case, it is the variable n in line 14.

Curiously enough, the automatic variable n in line 25 has the value 0. n has an undefined value; therefore, the program has undefined behavior. This is also true for the variable mem of the struct T2 since T2().mem returns an undefined value.

## Sample Code 2
Now, we will rewrite the program with the help of auto.
```
// initAuto.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
struct T1 {};
 
struct T2{
    int mem = 0;  // auto mem= 0 is an error
 public:
    T2() {}
};
 
auto n = 0;
 
int main(){
  
  std::cout << std::endl;
  
  using namespace std::string_literals;
  
  auto n = 0;
  auto s = ""s;      
  auto t1= T1();               
  auto t2= T2();
    
  std::cout << "::n " << ::n << std::endl;
  std::cout << "n: " << n << std::endl;
  std::cout << "s: " << s << std::endl;
  std::cout << "T2().mem: " << T2().mem << std::endl;
  
  std::cout << std::endl;
                      
}
```

## Explanation 2
Two lines in the source code are especially interesting. Firstly, in line 9, the current standard forbids the code to initialize non-constant members of a struct with auto. Therefore, we must use an explicit type. For more on the C++ standardization committee regarding this issue, read this: article.

Secondly, in line 23, C++14 gets C++ string literals. We build them by using a C string literal ("") and adding the suffix s (""s). For convenience, we already imported that in line 20: using namespace std::string_literals.

The output of the program is not as thrilling as it is only for completeness. T2().mem has the value 0.

# Refactorization
auto supports the refactorization of our code. Firstly, it is very easy to restructure our code when there is no type information. Secondly, the compiler automatically takes care of the right types. What does that mean? We will give an answer in the form of a code snippet. Firstly, examine the code without auto:

```
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
int sum =  a * b * 3;
int res = sum + 10; 
```
When we replace the variable b of type int by a double 10.5, we must adjust all dependent types, which is laborious and dangerous. We must use the right types to handle the issue of narrowing and other intelligent phenomenons in C++.
```
int a2 = 5;
double b2 = 10.5;
double sum2 = a2 * b2 * 3;
double res2 = sum2 * 10.5;
```

# Sample Code 3
This danger is not present in case of auto. Everything happens auto-matically. Let us an example of this:
```
// refactAuto.cpp

#include <typeinfo>
#include <iostream>

int main(){
  
  std::cout << std::endl;

  auto a = 5;
  auto b = 10;
  auto sum =  a * b * 3;
  auto res = sum + 10; 
  std::cout << "typeid(res).name(): " << typeid(res).name() << std::endl;
  
  auto a2 = 5;
  auto b2 = 10.5;
  auto sum2 = a2 * b2 * 3;
  auto res2 = sum2 * 10;  
  std::cout << "typeid(res2).name(): " << typeid(res2).name() << std::endl;
  
  auto a3 = 5;
  auto b3 = 10;
  auto sum3 = a3 * b3 * 3.1f;
  auto res3 = sum3 * 10;  
  std::cout << "typeid(res3).name(): " << typeid(res3).name() << std::endl;
  
  std::cout << std::endl;
   
}
```
## Explanation 3
The small variations of the code snippet always determine the right type of res, res2, or res3 which is the job of the compiler. The variable b2 in line 17 is of type double and therefore, res2 is also double.

The variable sum3 in line 24 becomes a float due to multiplication with the literal float 3.1f (a float type). Therefore, the final result, res3, is also a float type. To access the data type from the compiler, we have used the typeid operator which is defined in the header typeinfo.

>  Often, developers in the embedded domain do not need the correct type but rather a concrete type, such as int. In the case of this example, this is a nice trick. When we switch from the implicit type with auto to the concrete type within, we must make the assignment with the help of {} braces (int res3 = {sum3 * 10};). Thanks to {} the compiler checks if a narrowing conversion has taken place. If we get an error, we know the current type is not what we expected.

Let’s take a look at an example of this topic in the next lesson.

# -Examples
Examples for using the auto keyword in different cases.
We'll cover the following
- Example 1

  - Explanation

# Example 1
```
// auto.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int func(int){return 2011;}

int main(){

  auto i = 5;                  // int
  auto& intRef = i;            // int&
  auto* intPoint = &i;         // int*
  const auto constInt = i;     // const int
  static auto staticInt = 10;  // static int

  std::vector<int> myVec;
  auto vec = myVec;           // std::vector<int>
  auto& vecRef = vec;         // std::vector<int>&

  int myData[10];
  auto v1 = myData;           // int*
  auto& v2 = myData;          // int (&)[10]

  auto myFunc = func;          // (int)(*)(int)
  auto& myFuncRef = func;      // (int)(&)(int)

  // define a function pointer
  int (*myAdd1)(int, int) = [] (int a, int b){return a + b;};

  // use type inference of the C++11 compiler
  auto myAdd2 = [](int a, int b){return a + b;};

  std::cout << "\n";

  // use the function pointer
  std::cout << "myAdd1(1, 2) = " << myAdd1(1, 2) << std::endl;

  // use the auto variable
  std::cout << "myAdd2(1, 2) = " << myAdd2(1, 2) << std::endl;

  std::cout << "\n";

}
```
## Explanation
In the example above, the complier automatically deduces the types depending on the value stored in the variable. The corresponding types of variables are mentioned in the in-line comments.

- In line 10, we have defined a variable, i and its type is deduced to be int because of the value 5 stored in it.
- In lines 11 - 14, we have copied the values into different variables and their type is deduced auto-matically depending on the value stored in it.
- Similarly, in lines 17 - 18, we copy a vector and its reference by using the assignment operator =. auto keyword takes care of vec and vecRef types.
- In lines 24 - 25, auto determines the type of myFunc as function pointer and myFuncRef as a reference to that function.
- In line 31, we have defined a lambda expression whose return type is inferred by the C++ compiler since we have used the auto keyword.

## Example 2
```
// autoExplicit.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
#include <future>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <tuple>

int main(){

  auto myInts = {1, 2, 3};
  auto myIntBegin = myInts.begin();       

  std::map<int, std::string> myMap = {{1, std::string("one")}, {2, std::string("two")}};
  auto myMapBegin = myMap.begin();      

  auto func = [](const std::string& a){ return a;};

  auto futureLambda = std::async([]{ return std::string("Hello"); });

  auto begin = std::chrono::system_clock::now();

  auto pa = std::make_pair(1, std::string("second"));

  auto tup = std::make_tuple(std::string("second"), 4, 1.1, true, 'a');

}
```

## Explanation
In the example above, we used the auto keyword in the highlighted lines and left it for the compiler to infer the type during the run time. Since we are handling different C++ libraries when writing extensive codes, it becomes difficult to keep track of each type. auto helps by bypassing this problem.

Let’s test your understanding of this concept with an exercise in the next lesson.

# -Exercise
In this exercise, you will replace the auto keyword with the corresponding types.
#Task
Make the type deduction of auto explicit and replace as many usages of auto in the code with their explicit types.
Line 17 cannot be converted, because the lambda expression has a unique but not a nearer specified type.
> Note: Don’t forget the necessary headers.
```
// autoExplicit.cpp 
#include <chrono>
#include <future>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <tuple>

int main(){

  auto myInts = {1, 2, 3};
  auto myIntBegin = myInts.begin();

  std::map<int, std::string> myMap = {{1, std::string("one")}, {2, std::string("two")}};
  auto myMapBegin = myMap.begin();

  auto func = [](const std::string& a){ return a;};

  auto futureLambda = std::async([]{ return std::string("Hello "); });

  auto begin = std::chrono::system_clock::now();

  auto pa = std::make_pair(1, std::string("second"));

  auto tup = std::make_tuple(std::string("second"), 4, 1.1, true, 'a');

}
```
The solution to this task is available in the next lesson.

# -Solution
In this lesson, we will go over the solution to replacing the auto keyword with explicit data types.
```
// C++ 14
#include <chrono>
#include <functional>

#include <future>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <map>
#include <string>
#include <thread>
#include <tuple>

int main(){

  std::initializer_list<int> myInts = {1, 2, 3};
  std::initializer_list<int>::iterator myIntBegin = myInts.begin();

  std::map<int, std::string> myMap = {{1, std::string("one")}, {2, std::string("two")}};
  std::map<int, std::string>::iterator myMapBegin = myMap.begin();

  std::function<std::string(const std::string&)> func = [](const std::string& a){ return a; };

  std::future<std::string> futureLambda = std::async([]{ return std::string("Hello"); });

  std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock> begin = std::chrono::system_clock::now();

  std::pair<int, std::string> pa = std::make_pair(1, std::string("second"));

  std::tuple<std::string, int, double, bool, char> tup = std::make_tuple(std::string("second"), 4, 1.1, true, 'a');

}
```
# Explanation
We have changed the code in the exercise and replaced the auto keywords with their explicit deduction types.
- In line 14, we have defined an std::initializer_list<int> and in line 15, we have defined its iterator std::initializer_list<int>::iterator.
- In line 17, we have defined a map std::map<int, std::string> and in line 18, we have defined its iterator std::map<int, std::string>::iterator
- In line 20, we have defined a std::function<std::string(const std::string&)> for the lambda expression.
- In line 22, we have defined a std::future<std::string>.
- In line 24, we have defined std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock>.
- In line 26, we have defined std::pair<int, std::string>.
- In line 28, we have defined a tuple with std::tuple<std::string, int, double, bool, char>.
Replacing auto with explicit types can be a difficult task since the user must remember the relevant details for the libraries in use. As an embedded systems programmer, you must work with features from multiple libraries, and the auto helps you handle those features.

In the next lesson, we will learn about scoped enumerations.
