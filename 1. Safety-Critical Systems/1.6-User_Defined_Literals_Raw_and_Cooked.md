# User-Defined Literals: Raw and Cooked
In this lesson, we will study raw and cooked forms of user-defined literals.

We'll cover the following
- The Four User-Defined Literals
  - Raw and Cooked Forms

# The Four User-Defined Literals
C++11 has user-defined literals for characters, C strings, integers, and floating point numbers. For integers and floating point numbers, they are available in raw and cooked form. Due to C++14, we have built-in literals for binary numbers, C++ strings, complex numbers, and time units.

To clarify, below are the raw and cooked variations of the literal types.

How should we read the table? The data type character has the form of character_suffix, such as the example at 's'_c. The compiler tries to invoke the literal operator operator"" _c('s'). The character, in this case, is of the type char. C++ also supports the data type char, the data type wchar_t, char16_t, and char32_t. We can use these types as a base for our C string. In the table, we used a char. The table shows that the compiler maps the C string "hi"_i18 to the literal operator operator"" _i18n("hi",2). The length of the C string is 2.

# Raw and Cooked Forms
The compiler can map integers or floating point numbers to integers (unsigned long long int) or floating point numbers (long double), but the compiler can also map them to C strings.

The first variant is called cooked form, and the second variant is called raw form. The compiler will use the raw form if the literal operator wants its arguments as C string. If not, the compiler uses the cooked form. If we implement both versions, the compiler will choose the cooked form since it has higher priority.

Admittedly, the last lines have a lot of potential for confusion. To solve this, we sum up all the information from the perspective of the signatures in the following table. The first column has the signature of the literal operator. The second column has the type of the user-defined literal, and the last column is an example of a user-defined literal that fits the signature of the literal operator.

Let’s look at an example of this topic in the next lesson.

## -Example
We’ll take a look at an example of raw and cooked forms of user-defined literals.

### main.cpp
```
// average.cpp

#include "distance.h"
#include "unit.h"

using namespace Distance::Unit;

int main(){

  std:: cout << std::endl;

  std::cout << "1.0_km: " << 1.0_km << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_m: " << 1.0_m << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_dm: " << 1.0_dm << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_cm: " << 1.0_cm << std::endl;
  
  std::cout << std::endl;

  std::cout << "0.001 * 1.0_km: " << 0.001 * 1.0_km << std::endl;
  std::cout << "10 * 1_dm: " << 10 * 1.0_dm << std::endl;
  std::cout << "100 * 1.0cm: " << 100 * 1.0_cm << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1_.0km / 1000: " << 1.0_km / 1000 << std::endl;

  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "1.0_km + 2.0_dm +  3.0_dm + 4.0_cm: " << 1.0_km + 2.0_dm +  3.0_dm + 4.0_cm << std::endl;
  std::cout << std::endl;
  
  auto work= 63.0_km;
  auto workPerDay= 2 * work;
  auto abbrevationToWork= 5400.0_m;
  auto workout= 2 * 1600.0_m;
  auto shopping= 2 * 1200.0_m;
  
  auto distPerWeek1= 4*workPerDay-3*abbrevationToWork+ workout+ shopping;
  auto distPerWeek2= 4*workPerDay-3*abbrevationToWork+ 2*workout;
  auto distPerWeek3= 4*workout + 2*shopping;
  auto distPerWeek4= 5*workout + shopping;

  std::cout << "distPerWeek1: " << distPerWeek1 << std::endl;
  
  auto averageDistance= getAverageDistance({distPerWeek1,distPerWeek2,distPerWeek3,distPerWeek4});
  std::cout<< "averageDistance: " << averageDistance << std::endl;
  
  std::cout << std::endl;

}
```

### distance.h
```
// distance.h

#ifndef DISTANCE_H
#define DISTANCE_H

#include <iostream>
#include <ostream>


namespace Distance{
  class MyDistance{
    public:
      MyDistance(double i):m(i){}

      friend MyDistance operator+(const MyDistance& a, const MyDistance& b){
        return MyDistance(a.m + b.m);
      }
      friend MyDistance operator-(const MyDistance& a,const MyDistance& b){
        return MyDistance(a.m - b.m);
      }
	  
	  friend MyDistance operator*(double m, const MyDistance& a){
	    return MyDistance(m*a.m);
	  }
	  
	  friend MyDistance operator/(const MyDistance& a, int n){
	    return MyDistance(a.m/n);
	  }
	  
      friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream &out, const MyDistance& myDist){
        out << myDist.m << " m";
        return out;
      }
	private:
	  double m;
	  
  };
  
}
  
Distance::MyDistance getAverageDistance(std::initializer_list<Distance::MyDistance> inList){
  auto sum= Distance::MyDistance{0.0};
  for (auto i: inList) sum = sum + i ;
  return sum/inList.size(); 
}


#endif
```


### unit.h
```
// unit.h

#ifndef UNIT_H
#define UNIT_H

#include "distance.h"

namespace Distance{

  namespace Unit{
    MyDistance operator "" _km(const char* k){
      return MyDistance(1000* std::stold(k));
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _m(const char* m){
      return MyDistance(std::stold(m));
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _dm(const char* d){
      return MyDistance(std::stold(d)/10);
    }
    MyDistance operator "" _cm(const char* c){
      return MyDistance(std::stold(c)/100);
    }
  }
}

#endif
```

## Explanation
- We did our computations based on user-defined literals of the type long double in the cooked form. To make our calculation in the raw form, we must only adjust the literal operators.
- It is only necessary to convert the arguments of the literal operator from type C string to long double. That is quite easy to do with the new function std::stold.

Now that we have gone over user-defined literals, we will study built-in literals in the next lesson.
