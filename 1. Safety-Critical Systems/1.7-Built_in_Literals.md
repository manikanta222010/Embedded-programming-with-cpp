# Built-in Literals
A shorthand introduction to the new built-in literals in C++ 14.

# New Built-in Literals with C++14
In C++ 14, there are a few new built-in literals. These are built-in literals for binary numbers, C++ strings, complex numbers, and time units. At first, let go over an overview of this new concept.

You must keep a few special rules in mind. There is a main different between the built-in literals and the user-defined literals: the built-in literals have no underscore. For the first time, C++ supports (with C++14) a C++ string literal. So far, C++ only supported C-string literals, meaning that we must always use a C-string literal to initialize a C++ string. The time literals are also very convenient since they implicitly know their unit and support basic arithmetic. They are of the type std::chrono::duration.

Letâ€™s take a look at an example of this topic in the next lesson.

## -Example
Children often complain that their school day is exhausting. The question arises, how many seconds does a child need for a typical school day? The program provides the answer.

> The base unit for time is second.

```
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>

using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals;

int main(){

  std::cout << std::endl;

  typedef std::chrono::duration<long long, std::ratio<2700>> hour;
  auto schoolHour= hour(1);
  // auto schoolHour= 45min;

  auto shortBreak= 300s;
  auto longBreak= 0.25h;

  auto schoolWay= 15min;
  auto homework= 2h;

  auto schoolDayInSeconds= 2*schoolWay + 6 * schoolHour + 4 * shortBreak + longBreak + homework;

  std::cout << "School day in seconds: " << schoolDayInSeconds.count() << std::endl;

  std::chrono::duration<double, std::ratio<3600>> schoolDayInHours = schoolDayInSeconds;
  std::chrono::duration<double, std::ratio<60>> schoolDayInMinutes = schoolDayInSeconds;
  std::chrono::duration<double, std::ratio<1, 1000>> schoolDayInMilliseconds= schoolDayInSeconds;

  std::cout << "School day in hours: " << schoolDayInHours.count() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "School day in minutes: " << schoolDayInMinutes.count() << std::endl;
  std::cout << "School day in milliseconds: " << schoolDayInMilliseconds.count() << std::endl;

  std::cout << std::endl;

}
```

## Explanation
The program is entirely self-explanatory. The suffixes are expressive enough. Making the correct additions is the job of the compiler. The time literals support the base arithmetic addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operation.

In the next lesson, we will discuss assertions at compile time.
