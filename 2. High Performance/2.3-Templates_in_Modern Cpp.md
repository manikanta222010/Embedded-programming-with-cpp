#Templates in Modern C++
The given lesson provides an introduction to templates in modern C++.

**Templates** are one of the outstanding features of C++. They become more and more important with each new C++ standard. Templates provide abstraction without an abstraction penalty. There are two kinds of templates: templates for classes, **class template**, or for functions, **function template**. Function templates are used to create concrete types of functions.

- Class templates or function templates are families of classes or functions.
- Templates play an important role in the development of generic libraries, Standard Template Library.

Letâ€™s discuss function templates in the next lesson.
