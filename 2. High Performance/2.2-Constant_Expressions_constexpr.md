# Constant Expressions
With the keyword constexpr, we define an expression that can be evaluated at compile time. constexpr can be used for variables, functions, and user-defined types. An expression that is evaluated at compile time has many advantages. A constant expression does the following:

- It can be evaluated at compile time.
- It gives the compiler deep insight into the code.
- It is implicitly thread-safe.
- It can be constructed in the read-only memory (ROM-able).

# constexpr - Variables and Objects

If we declare a variable as constexpr, the compiler will evaluate them at compile time. This holds true both for built-in types and for instantiations of user-defined types. There are a few restrictions for objects in order to evaluate them at compile time.

To make this process easier, we will use built-in types like bool, char, int, and double. We call the remaining data types as user-defined data types, for example, std::string, types from the C++ library, and user-defined data types. User-defined types typically hold built-in types.

## Variables
By using the keyword constexpr, the variable becomes a constant expression.
```
constexpr double myDouble= 5.2;
```
Therefore, we can use the variable in contexts that require a constant expression, for example, if we want to define the size of an array. This must be done at compile time.

For the declaration of a constexpr variable, we must consider a few rules.

The variable:
- is implicitly const.
- must be initialized.
- requires a constant expression for initialization.
If we evaluate a variable at compile time, the variable only depends on values that can be evaluated at compile time.

The objects are created by the invocation of the constructor.

## User-Defined Types
The constructor has a few special rules.

A constexpr constructor

1. can only be invoked with constant expressions.
2. cannot use exception handling.
3. must be declared as default or delete, or the function body must be empty (C++11).
The constexpr user-defined type

- cannot have virtual base classes.
- requires that each base object and each non-static member must be initialized in the initialization list of the constructor or directly in the class body.
- Consequently, it holds that each used constructor (e.g of a base class) must be constexpr constructor and the applied initializers have to be constant expressions.

### Example
```
struct MyDouble{
  double myVal;
  constexpr MyDouble(double v): myVal(v){} 
  constexpr double getVal(){return myVal;}
};
```

- The constructor has to be an empty and a constant expression.
- The user-defined type can have methods that are constant expressions and can have methods that aren’t constant expressions.
- Instances of MyDouble can be instantiated at compile time.

## Functions
constexpr functions have the potential to run at compile time. With constexpr functions, we can perform many calculations at compile time. Therefore, the result of the calculation is available at runtime and is stored as a constant in the ROM available. In addition, constexpr functions are implicitly inline.

A constexpr function can be invoked with a non-constexpr value. In this case, the function runs at runtime. When used in an expression, the constexpr function is executed at compile time, which is evaluated at compile time such as static_assert or the definition of a C-array. A constexpr function is also executed at compile time, when the result is requested at compile time : constexpr auto res = constexprFunction().

For constexpr functions there are a few restrictions:

The function
- must be non-virtual.
- must have arguments and a return value of a literal type. Literal types are the types of constexpr variables.
- can only have one return statement.
- - - must return a value.
- - will be executed at compile time if invoked within a constant expression.
- can only have a function body consisting out of a return statement.
- must have a constant return value
- is implicitly inline.

### Examples
```
constexpr int fac(int n)
  {return n > 0 ? n * fac(n-1): 1;}

constexpr int gcd(int a, int b){
  return (b == 0) ? a : gcd(b, a % b);}
```

## Functions with C++14
The syntax of constexpr functions was massively improved with the change from C++11 to C++14. In C++11, we had to consider which features we can use in a constexpr function. With C++14, we need only consider which feature we cannot use in a constexpr function.

constexpr functions in C++14
- can have variables that must be initialized by a constant expression.
- can have loops.
- cannot have static or thread_local data.
- can have conditional jump instructions or loop instructions.
- can have more than one instruction.

### Example
```
constexpr auto gcd(int a, int b){
  while (b != 0){
    auto t= b;
    b= a % b;
    a= t;
  }
  return a;
}
```

# Magic of constexpr Functions
```
// constexpr14.cpp

#include <iostream>

constexpr auto gcd(int a, int b){
  while (b != 0){
    auto t= b;
    b= a % b;
    a= t;
  }
  return a;
}

int main(){
  
 std::cout << std::endl;
  
  constexpr int i= gcd(11,121);     // (1)
  
  int a= 11;
  int b= 121;
  int j= gcd(a,b);                  // (2)

  std::cout << "gcd(11,121): " << i << std::endl;
  std::cout << "gcd(a,b): " << j << std::endl;
  
  std::cout << std::endl;
 
}
```
Line 18 calculates the result i at compile time, and of line 22 j at runtime. The compiler would complain when we declare j as constexpr: constexpr int j = gcd(a, b). The problem is that int a, and int b are not constant expressions.

The output of the program should not present us with a challenge.

The challenge may start now. Let’s see the magic with Compiler Explorer.

Line 1 in the program code above boils down to the constant 11 in the following expression: mov DWORD PTR[rbp-4], 11 (line 33 in screenshot). In contrast, line 32 is a function call: call gcd(int, int) (line 40 in the screenshot).

# Pure Functions
We can execute constexpr functions at runtime. If we take the return value of a constexpr function by a constant expression, the compiler will perform the function at compile time. The question is: Is there a reason to perform a constexpr function at runtime? Let’s take a look at one main reason.

A constexpr function can be potentially performed at compile time. There is no state at compile time, as we are in a pure functional sublanguage of the imperative programming language C++. This means that at compile time, executed functions must be pure functions. When we use the constexpr function at runtime, the function remains pure.

**Pure functions** always return the same result when given the same arguments. Pure functions are like infinitely large tables from which we get our value. Referential transparency is the guarantee that an expression always returns the same result when given the same arguments.

Pure functions are often called mathematical functions.

## Advantages
Pure functions have many advantages:

- The function call can be replaced by the result.
- The execution of pure functions can automatically be distributed to other threads.
- Function calls can be reordered.
- They can easily be refactored.
The last three points hold because pure functions have no state and no dependency on the environment.

There are many good reasons to use constexpr functions. The table shows the key points of pure and impure functions.

The examples in the next lesson will build on your understanding of this topic.

## -Examples
## Example 1
```
//C++ 11
// constExpression.cpp
#include <iostream>

constexpr int square(int x) { return x * x; }
constexpr int squareToSquare(int x){ return square(square(x));}

int main() {

  std::cout << std::endl;

  int a = 10;
  static_assert(square(a) == 100, "you calculated it wrong");
  static_assert(squareToSquare(10) == 10000 , "you calculated it wrong");

  std::cout<< "square(10)= " << square(10) << std::endl;
  std::cout<< "squareToSquare(10)= " << squareToSquare(10) << std::endl;
  
  constexpr int constExpr= square(10);

  int arrayClassic[100];
  int arrayNewWithConstExpression[constExpr];
  int arrayNewWithConstExpressioFunction[square(10)];

  std::cout << std::endl;

}
```

## Explanation
- In the example above, we implemented two constexpr functions for C++11: constexpr int square(int x) and constexpr int squareToSquare(int x). Both functions follow the conventions for constexpr functions definition in C++11.
- The assertation in lines 13 and 14 fail since a is not a literal type. Making a constexpr variable enables the code compilation to pass those assertations.
- In line 19, we initialized a constexpr variable constExpr using the square function.
- In lines 21-23, we have initialized three arrays in three ways:
    1. by using a constant 100.
    2. by using a constexpr variable constExpr.
    3. by calling the function square(10). Notice that the input argument for this function call is a constant.

## Example 2
```
//constExpressionCpp14.cpp
#include <iostream>

constexpr int gcd(int a, int b){
  while (b != 0){
    auto t= b;
    b= a % b;
    a= t;
  }
  return a;
}

int main(){

  constexpr auto res= gcd(100, 10);
  std::cout << "gcd(100, 10) " << res << std::endl;

}
```
## Explanation
- The difference between ordinary functions and constexpr functions in C++14 is minimal. It is quite easy to implement the gcd algorithm in C++14 as a constexpr function.
- We have defined res as a constexpr variable, and its type is automatically determined by auto.
- Note that we cannot use a non-constant value as input arguments for the gcd function.

Test your knowledge of this topic with an exercise in the next lesson.

# Try it Out!
## Task 1
Use the structure MyDouble in your program. How can you check that instances of MyDouble will be created at compile time?

## Task 2
What will happen if MyDouble is used in a non-constant expression?

```
#include <iostream>

struct MyDouble{ 
  double myVal;
  constexpr MyDouble(double v): myVal(v){}
  constexpr double getVal(){return myVal;} 
};
int main() {
  // your code goes here
  std::cout << "Hello World";
  return 0;
}
```

In the next lesson, we will learn about associative containers in modern C++.
